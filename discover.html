                        <p cite="https://en.unesco.org/global-geoparks/jeju-island">Jeju Island UNESCO Global Geopark is a Quaternary shield volcanic island characterized by an overall gentle topography and an elliptical shape, situated off the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula. The island was produced by volcanic activity which occurred from about 2 million years ago until historic times. Basaltic to trachytic lavas occur extensively on the island together with diverse volcanic landforms, including Mount Hallasan that rises at the center of the island and about 360 volcanic cones that are scattered throughout the island. In the subsurface, however, numerous hydromagmatic volcanoes (tuff rings and tuff cones) produced by explosive hydrovolcanic activity occur extensively together with intervening volcanoclastic sedimentary deposits.

Baengnokdam, the crater and lake located at the peak of Hallasan Mountain, and about 40 oreums, a beautiful sight of steep and fantastic rock cliffs are designated in 1966 and 1970 as Nature Monument and National Park respectively, <span class="dots">...</span><button onclick="myFunction(0)" class="myBtn">READ MORE  &gt;</button><span class="more"> and in 2002 designated as a bio-reserve area by UNESCO.As the peak of Hallasan Mountain is made of diverse volcanic characteristics, depending on the angle of one’s view, one can feel its uniqueness. To the west of Baengnokdam crater, a steep shape formed by basalt lava of high viscosity is found and to the east, low viscosity basalt lava formed a gentle plateau. The south slope is so beautiful that it is captured in a folktale which states the story of immortals that played in the lake. Hallasan Mountain is also a mountain where fir tree forest is found which is unique of its kind in the world. At 1,400m above sea level an endemic species of cinder cones including pine trees are grown. It also possesses an outstanding biological research value in the study of cinder cones. Besides this at 1,700m, are distributed 39 different kinds of polar species which play a very important part in the study of alpine life such as the Jeju weasel, Jeju salamander, women diver snake, etc., are seen in Hallasan Mountain. Well endowed with natural resources of scientific values, Hallasan Mountain is a noted mountain worldwide.<button onclick="myFunction(0)" class="myLessBtn">&lt; READ LESS</button></span></p>
